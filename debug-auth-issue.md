# Authentication Issue Diagnosis

## Problem Identified: Truncated Supabase Publishable Key

### Current Key in .env.local:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_mT3MRZEJ0wNKBRvYS4S8bA_sAfqszRu
```

### Issue:

- This key is only 47 characters after the `sb_publishable_` prefix
- Valid Supabase publishable keys are typically 100+ characters long
- The key appears to be truncated

### Evidence:

1. ✅ Supabase URL is valid: `https://rwyaipbxlvrilagkirsq.supabase.co`
2. ✅ Key format starts correctly: `sb_publishable_`
3. ❌ Key length is too short (47 chars vs expected 100+)
4. ❌ API calls to create user hang indefinitely
5. ❌ Authentication fails silently

### Solution Required:

The user needs to provide the complete, untruncated Supabase publishable key from their Supabase project dashboard.

### Next Steps:

1. User should go to Supabase dashboard → Project Settings → API
2. Copy the complete "anon/public" key (the publishable key)
3. Update .env.local with the full key
4. Restart the development server

### Current Status:

Authentication is completely broken due to invalid API key. All other authentication fixes are working correctly, but cannot function with a truncated key.
